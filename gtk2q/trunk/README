Welcome to the gtk/g* bindings for pascal (Freepascal, Delphi)

This is an effort to provide bindings for the gtk toolkit[1] for pascal
languages (Delphi (http://www.borland.com/) and Freepascal
(http://www.freepascal.org/).

Minimum gtk version is 2.4.0.

*** Directory layout

= gtk-pascal-gen =

The generator. Keep in mind that it needs to be quite standalone workable with no package dependent working data since it is used in other g* bindings as well.

= input =

The input xml directory used to generate the wrappers of (you could update them by the ones in the gtk tarball, docs/reference/*/xml at your own risk)

= output =

The directory where the output pas files are kept.
Note that they is not in the version control system because they are generated files.
Generate the files by calling "gtk-pascal-gen" (installed).

If you don't have Python, extract fallback-output.tar.gz instead and use that.

= apptemplates = 

Templates to use to create a gtk app.

= static =
Some files that cannot be autogenerated because they are too complex/weird/both are manually created in here. Also support (boilerplate) code.

= unsorted =

Things that are not included in the project yet but might be interesting.

= fallback-output.tar.gz =

Tarball to use instead of the python generator when everything else fails.

= h =

Header files of gtk to steal the enums from.

= overrides =

Overrides for some xml files that are not formatted as the generator expects.

= tests =

Some unit tests and mini examples.

*** Installation steps

1. cd gtk-pascal-gen
2. make
3. make install
4. cd ..
5. cd gtk2q
6. gtk-pascal-gen
7. make
8. make install
(or use the gtk2qD7.dpk to compile)

*** Where are examples

*** Internals

- Refcounting
* Widgets
* Non-widgets

- Userdata
