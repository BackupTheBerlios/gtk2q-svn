Welcome to the gtk/g* bindings for pascal (Freepascal, Delphi)

This is an effort to provide bindings for the gtk toolkit[1] for pascal
languages (Delphi (http://www.borland.com/) and Freepascal
(http://www.freepascal.org/).

Minimum gtk version is 2.4.0.

*** Directory layout

gtk-pascal-gen
	The generator. Keep in mind that it needs to be quite standalone
	workable with no package dependent workdata since it is used in
	other g* bindings as well.

input
	The input xml directory used to generate the wrappers of
	(you could update them by the ones in the gtk tarball, 
	docs/reference/*/xml at your own risk)

output
	The directory where the output pas files are kept.
	Note that they is not in the version control system because they are
	generated files.
	Generate the files by calling "./gen" in the gtk-pascal-gen
	directory.

	If you don't have python, extract fallback-output.tar.gz instead and
	use that.

apptemplates
	Templates to use to create a gtk app.

static
	Some files that cannot be autogenerated because they are too
	complex/weird/both are manually created in here. Also support stuff.

unsorted
	Things that are not included in the project yet but might be
	interesting.

fallback-output.tar.gz
	Tarball to use instead of the python generator when all else fails.

h
	Header files of gtk to steal the enums from.

overrides
	Overrides for some xml files that are not formatted as the generator
	expects.

tests
	Some unit tests and mini examples.

*** Installation steps

1. cd gtk-pascal-gen
2. ./gen
3. cd ..
4. either 'make' or use the gtk2qD7.dpk to compile
