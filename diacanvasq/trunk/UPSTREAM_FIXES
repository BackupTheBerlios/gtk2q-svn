Todo:

mark DiaCanvasItem.event signal as deprecated in the docs (as already is in the h)
DiaCanvas.extents-changed signal arg1 = ? -> DiaRectangle*!!

gint        dia_canvas_group_foreach        (DiaCanvasItem *item,
                                             DiaCanvasItemForeachFunc func,
                                             gpointer data);
what the heck...


dia_canvas_find_objects_in_rectangle () ? what is returned? "objects"? what?

DiaCanvasItem
  "affine"               DiaCanvasItemAffine  : Read / Write
  "handles"              DiaCanvasItemHandles : Read / Write
