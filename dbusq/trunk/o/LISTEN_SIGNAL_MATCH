Signal matching on arguments

Starting with D-Bus 0.36 and the (0, 43, 0) version of the python bindings
you can now add a match on arguments being sent in a signal. This is useful
for instance for only getting NameOwnerChanged signals for your service.
Lets say we create a name on the bus called 'org.foo.MyName' we could also
add a match to just get NameOwnerChanges for that name as such:

bus.add_signal_receiver(myname_changed,
                        'NameOwnerChanged',
                        'org.freedesktop.DBus',
                        'org.freedesktop.DBus',
                        '/org/freedesktop/DBus',
                        arg0='org.foo.MyName')

It is as simple as that. To match the second arg you would use arg1=, the
third arg2=, etc.
